# Architecture-Driven Governance, Risk, and Compliance

This repository documents an architecture-first framework for deterministic cybersecurity risk governance in IT/OT and industrial environments.

## Core Concepts
- Architecture is the system of record for risk
- Risk flows downward; controls flow upward
- Purdue risk domains represent trust and consequence boundaries
- Level 3.5 (Operations DMZ) is a mandatory mediation domain
- Risk is modeled through architectural patterns, not checklists

## What This Is
- A reference framework
- Practitioner-developed
- Tool-agnostic
- Regulation-aligned

## What This Is Not
- A product
- A vendor solution
- A checklist

Status: Working reference model
