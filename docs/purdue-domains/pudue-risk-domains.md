## Domain Overview

- **Level 5 – External / Vendors**  
  Untrusted and external networks

- **Level 4 – Enterprise IT**  
  Corporate business systems

- **Level 3.5 – Operations DMZ**  
  Mandatory trust mediation domain between IT and OT

- **Level 3 – Site Operations**  
  Local production and supervisory systems

- **Level 2 – Control Network**  
  Real-time industrial control traffic

- **Level 1 – Field Control**  
  Sensors, actuators, and local control logic

- **Level 0 – Physical Process**

Each domain carries unique trust assumptions, failure modes, and architectural expectations.
