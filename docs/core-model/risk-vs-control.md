# Risk Flow vs Control Flow
> See **Figure 02 — Risk Flow vs Control Flow** for the authoritative visual reference.

Risk and control do not behave symmetrically in complex systems.

## Risk Flow
Risk propagates downward across domains as trust expands, dependencies accumulate, and safety margins narrow.

As risk moves closer to physical process, consequence increases and recovery options decrease.

## Control Flow
Controls move upward from the physical and operational layers to intercept, mediate, and constrain risk before it reaches consequence.

Controls must be structurally positioned to be effective.

## Architectural Implication
If controls are placed downstream of risk propagation, they are forced to compensate rather than prevent.

This framework therefore prioritizes **architectural placement of control**, not control quantity.
