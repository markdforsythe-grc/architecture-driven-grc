# Purpose and Scope

The Architecture-Driven Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Framework establishes an architecture-first approach to cybersecurity risk management in IT, OT, and industrial environments.

Traditional risk frameworks treat architecture as an implementation detail. This framework treats architecture as the **primary system of record for risk**.

The purpose of this framework is to:
- Model how risk behaves structurally
- Establish deterministic relationships between systems, trust, and consequence
- Enable consistent governance across IT, OT, and ICS environments
- Support regulatory, operational, and safety objectives without checklist-driven compliance

This framework is intended for:
- Security and infrastructure architects
- OT and ICS practitioners
- Governance, risk, and compliance leaders
- Engineering and operations leadership

This framework does not prescribe tools or vendors. It defines **architectural intent and behavior**, allowing implementation flexibility while preserving risk integrity.
