# How This Framework Differs from Traditional Models

Most cybersecurity frameworks focus on control catalogs, maturity models, or probabilistic threat scenarios.

This framework differs in several key ways:

## Architecture as the System of Record
Risk is derived from system structure, trust relationships, and dependency chains — not from asset lists or threat likelihood estimates.

## Deterministic Risk Behavior
Risk propagation is modeled as a predictable outcome of architectural design decisions, not as a statistical event.

## Directional Flow
- Risk flows downward toward physical consequence
- Controls flow upward to intercept and constrain risk

This directional asymmetry is foundational and non-negotiable.

## Domain-Centric Modeling
Purdue risk domains represent trust and consequence boundaries. Each domain carries unique expectations and failure modes.

## Pattern-Based Risk Modeling
Risk emerges from recurring architectural failure patterns, not isolated vulnerabilities.

This allows risk to be reasoned about consistently across environments and scales.
